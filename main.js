// ## Phase 1: Set up

// Start off by creating your `main.js` file.

// After that, get `prompt-sync` working. To do this, first install `prompt-sync` using `npm`, then import it into your `main.js` file using a `require` statement.

// Start off your project by creating a loop that loops forever (use a while loop). Inside this loop you'll want to do three things:
// 1. Display content to the user
// 2. Prompt the user for an action
// 3. Handle that action accordingly

// Start off by adding a comment for each of these describing what you intend to do.

// This is also a good time to make your first commit in git!

const prompt = require("prompt-sync")();

//while loop

        // 1 display content to the user
                // if statement for whether or not array is empty, then console.log the result

        // 2 prompt the user for an action
                //prompt user to either add a todo item, or change an item to completed

        // 3 handle the action accordingly
                // if the user is adding an item, take the input and add it to the todo list array
                //if the user is completing an item, that item will need to be accessed in the array and changed
